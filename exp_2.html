<h2 align="center"><font color=black><u>Detailed explaination of 
space</u></font></h2><br>
<p>Space is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere. 
It contains all celestial bodies, including stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and 
galaxies. Space is characterized by a near vacuum, which means it has very low density and 
pressure, allowing objects to move freely without air resistance. The universe is estimated to be 
around 13.8 billion years old and is constantly expanding. Studying space helps us understand 
fundamental questions about the origins of the universe, the nature of matter, and the potential 
for life beyond Earth.</p>
