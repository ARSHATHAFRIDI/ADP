<h4> How have you been? I hope you are doing good. What about your family? I hope they 
    are 
    also doing great! Well, I'm writing this letter to ask you why you are not coming to college for the 
    last four days? 
    </h4>
    <h4>Is everything stable? What's the matter? You are not in college for the last 4 days. I hope 
    you 
    don't have any illness. The class teacher was asking about you. As you know there was practical 
    yesterday and you missed that too. 
    </h4>
    <h4>However, the teacher has told us that he will explain that practical once more. He has 
    scheduled it for Monday. I hope till then you will come. And if you are not well then please 
    inform 
    me about your health. I'm waiting for your reply.
